# Multi-Branch Conditional GAN on Fashion MNIST


## Overview

This repository presents a **Multi-Branch Conditional GAN (MB-CGAN)** designed to generate class-specific fashion images using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. Model 3 introduces a class-aware architecture that improves generation quality and training stability, particularly for imbalanced categories like Sandal, Sneaker, and Ankle Boot.

## Key Features

- **Branch-specific Generator:** Shared base encoder, followed by distinct sub-generators per class.
- **Conditional Discriminator:** Shared convolutional layers with class-specific binary decision branches (via `tf.where`).
- **Spectral Normalization** to stabilize discriminator training.
- **BinaryCrossentropy with Label Smoothing** for robustness against mode collapse.

##  Training Configuration

| Setting            | Value        |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Epochs            | 50           |
| Optimizer         | Adam         |
| Loss Function     | Binary Crossentropy (with label smoothing) |
| Initialization    | LazyBuild (to reduce resource waste) |

## Future Work

- **Stage-wise Branch Training:**  
  - *Phase 1:* Train on visually similar classes (e.g., Coat vs. Pullover)  
  - *Phase 2:* Fine-tune rare or dissimilar classes (e.g., Bag, Sneaker)

- **Longer Training Cycles:**  
  - Observe convergence trends in KID and loss metrics beyond 50 epochs.
